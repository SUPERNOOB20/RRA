How to do retro blocks
by yours truly

1) 45° gradient with colours of your choice (two opposite corners, basically)
2) 4bpp and as much dithering as you can
3) do left to right white to black gradient on a separate gradient
4) Duplicate said B&W gradient
5) lightest corner: screen blending mode. Darkest corner: multiply blending mode
6) Enjoy :3 ✨
